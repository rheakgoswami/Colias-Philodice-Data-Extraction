# Colias-Philodice-Data-Extraction
This project is done as a part of my 2022 Summer Internship with The Ries Lab of Butterfly Informatics (@RiesLabGU) at Georgetown University.

## Introduction to Colias Philodice
Colias philodice or the clouded sulphur is a North American butterfly. The adults are typically yellow or white and have wings with a dark brown border. On the front wings there is  dark spot and on the hind wings there is a yellow or orange spot. Sutdies have shown that butterflies with lighter colors have outcompeted the darker colors in recent years due to global warming. 

## Goal of Project
The overall purpose of this project is to understand how climate change, specifically global warming, has affected butterfly wings and body coloration in the US butterflies as well as the quantification of the rate of color change. This will help us understand their adaptive mechanism and strategies. This project aims to extract primarily color data (such as the saturation of orange, yellow, and white and the percentage of melanin) and relate these findings to temperature and altitude. We are investigating these relationships to better understand the effects of climate change and overall global surface temperature rise on this butterfly species. This repoistory contains data and visualizations relevant to the relationships mentioned above. 

## Research Topics
(1) Explore the rate of color change with temperature and time 
(2) Predict location and temperature of a butterfly based on its color 

## Source of Images and Data
The images used are available on the idigbio website. There are more than 38,000 images of this butterfly from the entire North America from  1900 to 2000. 

## Method 
Machine learning and AI techniques are used for the analysis.
