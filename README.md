# Colias-Philodice-Data-Extraction
This project is done as a part of my 2022 Summer Internship with The Ries Lab of Butterfly Informatics (@RiesLabGU) at Georgetown University.

## Introduction to Colias Philodice
Colias philodice or the clouded sulphur is a North American butterfly. The adults are typically yellow or white and have wings with a dark brown border. On the front wings there is  dark spot and on the hind wings there is a yellow or orange spot.

## Goal of Project
This project aims to extract primarily color data (such as the saturation of orange, yellow, and white and the percentage of melanin) and relate these findings to temperature and altitude. We are investigating these relationships to better understand the effects of climate change and overall global surface temperature rise on this butterfly species. This repoistory contains data and visualizations relevant to the relationships mentioned above.
